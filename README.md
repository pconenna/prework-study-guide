# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage hosts notes from the boot camp pre work. The work is meant to preoare students for coding bootcamp. 
I am familiar with basic web development so this was a refesher for me. I did catch one thing that made me think. The random topics funtion does not work the way I expected it to. The random topic var is declared outside of the fucntion. This means that every time the funciton is called it will be the same. The user would need to refresh th epage to get a different topic.

## Usage

Opneing the page will show the notes for each topic in the prework. Opening the console will show the JS functions running.
